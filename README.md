## Password generator app

Building this was fun, challenging and beautiful (I mean, look at that design hehe)

# Features

User can selects the length of the password between 4-20 characters

User can select to add the following: Include numbers, include symbols, include uppercase letters and include lowercase letters

Password generated on a button click

Password is copied to clipboard on button icon

Has a message if nothing is selected and also when password is copied to clipboard

Planning to add soon a password test strength

# Why this web app? 

I wanted a new challenge and found this suggestion on App ideas

And I can send the link to friends so they can have strong passwords.
